* planet-git

  This is the stub README.org for the "planet-git" project.  The whole
  project could be described as a stub.  There is still much work to do.
  Be aware this is the first project I ever done with Common Lisp, so if
  your eyes begin to bleed it's not my fault. You have been warned.
** Installation
   Currently this application isn't ready for any kind of real
   deployment.  So there will only be configuration instructions until
   this changes.
*** Configuration
    Configuration is done with a ini file.  Please look to the
    config.ini file in the root of the project for further details.

** Developing
   Getting the dev server running

   ./develop.lisp -c ./config.ini

*** Definitions

    Pages, return complete html pages
    Views are view controllers
    Fragments, return html fragments, parts of pages
